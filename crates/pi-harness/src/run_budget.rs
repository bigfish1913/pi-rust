//! Run-level budget for the agent loop.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The loop's only exit condition is "the model stopped asking for tools"
//! (`agent_loop.rs`: `while has_more_tool_calls || !pending_messages.is_empty()`).
//! Nothing bounds how long that takes, so a model that keeps emitting tool
//! calls runs until it decides to stop. One observed session did **112 turns in
//! a single run over 867 seconds** (`docs/llm-repetition-forensics.md` §二), and
//! the same run also paid an O(n²) per-delta clone cost (§4.7) — so the whole
//! 14 minutes was spent on a run the user had no way to interrupt or bound.
//!
//! This is the backstop, not the cure. The re-plan behaviour itself is fixed at
//! the source by keeping plan state in the visible channel (see the system
//! prompt's working-state rule and §8.8 of the forensics doc); this guard only
//! makes sure that when it *does* happen the run ends on a known budget instead
//! of running away.
//!
//! # Off by default (native pi parity)
//!
//! Native pi's loop has no turn/token ceiling at all — it runs until the model
//! stops asking for tools, an abort, or an error. `rpi` therefore ships the
//! guard **disabled** so default behaviour is identical to native, and you opt
//! in per process:
//!
//! ```text
//! RPI_MAX_TURNS_PER_RUN=120 rpi      # stop a single run after 120 turns
//! ```
//!
//! Unset, empty, non-numeric or `0` all mean "no ceiling", exactly like native.
//!
//! # Why only a turn cap
//!
//! A "no progress" detector was measured against the real session and rejected:
//! the longest run of consecutive turns without a successful write was **40**,
//! but those turns were legitimate exploration (nothing was duplicated — only
//! 3 of 148 tool calls were exact repeats). Any stall threshold low enough to
//! catch that would truncate ordinary work, so a single generous turn ceiling is
//! the only signal that is both simple and safe.
