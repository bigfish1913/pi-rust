/// Bytes accumulated before a batched text/thinking delta is emitted.

/// Every `AssistantMessageEvent` carries a full `partial: Arc<AssistantMessage>`
/// snapshot, so emitting one event per wire delta made a long stream quadratic
/// in the message length: measured, 8000 one-byte deltas cost ~105ms and the
/// scaling was superlinear. Batching keeps per-event work proportional to the
/// *batch* rather than to the whole message so far.
///
/// Channel boundaries always flush (`TextEnd`, `ThinkingEnd`, `ToolCallEnd`,
/// `Done`/`Error`, and a switch between text and thinking), so this changes only
/// how smoothly text appears — never the final message, and never the
/// concatenation of the deltas a consumer sees.

/// six seconds). This bounds that: a slow stream flushes on the timer, a fast
/// one on the byte count. 40ms is under three render frames, so it is
