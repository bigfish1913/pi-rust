//! Deadline-based countdown timer.
//!
//! Adapted from `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/.../countdown-timer.ts`.
//! The TS original spins a `setInterval`; the Rust port is **deadline-based**:
//! it stores an [`Instant`] and the host re-renders on the existing render tick
//! (the 120ms task that re-renders while a run is in flight already drives
//! visible updates). The owner reads [`remaining_secs`] each render.
//!
//! `Instant::now()` is allowed here — the `Date.now()`/`Instant::now()` ban in
//! this codebase applies only to Workflow scripts, not to normal Rust library
//! code.

use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

/// A simple countdown bounded by an absolute deadline.
///
/// No thread, no timer: compute remaining time on demand.
pub struct CountdownTimer {
    deadline: Instant,
}

impl CountdownTimer {
    /// Create a timer that expires after `duration`.
    pub fn new(duration: Duration) -> Self {
        Self {
            deadline: Instant::now() + duration,
        }
    }

    /// Seconds remaining until expiry (clamped at 0).
    pub fn remaining_secs(&self) -> u32 {
        let now = Instant::now();
        if now >= self.deadline {
            0
        } else {
            (self.deadline - now).as_secs() as u32
        }
    }

    /// Whether the deadline has passed.
    pub fn expired(&self) -> bool {
        Instant::now() >= self.deadline
